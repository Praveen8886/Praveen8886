<p>Located on the Hill of Eagles, Jaigarh fort was built in 1726 AD by Sawan Jai Singh II.
    <br> Jaigarh Fort is located at a height of 500 feet above sea level and offers panoramic views of the surrounding.

        <li style="background-color:blue ;">About Nahargarh fort</li>
        <P>Nahargarh Fort stands on the edge of the Aravalli Hills, overlooking the city of Jaipur in the Indian state of Rajasthan.<br>
             Along with Amer Fort and Jaigarh Fort, Nahargarh once formed a strong defence ring for the city. <br>The fort was originally named Sudershangarh, but it became known as Nahargarh, which means 'abode of tigers'.
             <br> The popular belief is that Nahar here stands for Nahar Singh Bhomia,<br>
              whose spirit haunted the place and obstructed construction of the fort.<br> Nahar's spirit was pacified by building a temple in his memory within the fort, which thus became known by his name.
